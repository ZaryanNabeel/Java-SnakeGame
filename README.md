# Java Snake Game using Swing
A classic Snake game implemented in Java using Swing for GUI rendering and AWT for event handling. This project showcases object-oriented design with modular code, interactive gameplay, dynamic levels, hurdles, and a persistent high score leaderboard.



##  OOP Concepts Used
Encapsulation: Game logic separated into classes (e.g., Snake, Apple, Score)

Inheritance: Custom behavior through JPanel, KeyListener, and ActionListener

Abstraction: Abstracting UI rendering and event handling logic

Modularity: Clear separation of rendering, logic, and data
